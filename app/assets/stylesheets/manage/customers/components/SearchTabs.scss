      The below styles have been added so that the actions dropdown works for now 
      but the actions dropdown needs to be replaced with Menu and Menu.Item and 
      Dropdown, as that will give an standard UX experience, since the actions 
      dropdown is a component that is shared across orders and customers, the 
      below is just a temporary fix and will need to be removed in the future, 
      Whenever the change mentioned above is done.

      NOTE :- Below fix no longer needed.
